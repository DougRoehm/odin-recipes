# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project will be to build a recipe website.

This will allow for the opportunity to get practice building a basic website
using HTML. 

Some of the skills that will be demonstrated are:
 - Formatting a basic html page.
 - Using headers to establish sections.
 - Using formatting to provide emphasis.
 - Using lists to better portray information such as ingredients.
 - Etc. 

The site will also serve as a canvas for further development as my coding
skill set matures.
